upgrade:
  - A new config option `policy_library_path` is added to the [DEFAULT]
    section. The string option specifies the directory from which
    Congress will load pre-written policies for easy activation later
    by an administrator.
    This option can be ignored if you do not want
    Congress to load pre-written policies from files. Due to MySQL limitations,
    the full path to each policy file cannot exceed 760 characters.
